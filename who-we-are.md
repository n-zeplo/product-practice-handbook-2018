# Who We Are

We are a group consisting of designers, developers, analysts and product people within ThoughtWorks. Through our shared experiences and research into TW product engagements we have compiled the resources that make up this book. This book is a resource to inform future engagements using our varied backgrounds and multi year experiences at TW on different projects as its foundation. We are always looking for help and verification of our findings and encourage all who read this book to reach out to us or make comments or begin discussions inside the gitbook.
