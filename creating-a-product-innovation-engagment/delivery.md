## Implement: Development, Go to Market and Metrics

##### Overview:

When implementation begins the team should have a clear understanding of the problem and solution they will be working on. This section will focus on the delivery team and ongoing product work and will cover topics including:

* Staffing and skill needs during this period

* Managing Scope and Expectations

* Keeping delivery and Roadmaps aligned

* Best Practices

  * Cross-functional pairing

  * Continuous User Research

* Resources:

  * Implementation Examples

  * Roadmap Examples / Templates

  * Design System / Styleguide Resources

  * Non-functional Requirement Resources / Tracking

##### Considerations:

* Further clarify implementation details and create estimates
* Decide on technology being used to produce the product and create boilerplate
* Regular delivery cadence using Agile / Scrum methodology
* Create CI and CD infrastructure and decide on cadence for pushing to production
* Document process, progress, and code / design choices as the code grows \(aids in next stage\)
