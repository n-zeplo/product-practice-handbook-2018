# Engagement Lifecycle

Every engagement goes through multiple phases that require us to think differently about the ways in which we approach the given set of problems. Here we will outline the lifecycle of engagements with suggestions on focuses during that key lifecycle moment.

### Identify a Product Innovation  Engagement

* Client has a problem and is not sure how to build a product to solve it

* Client has existing product that is not solving their needs

* Client is looking for new ways to expand their product / reach

## Engage

* Approach the client \(if not already approached\) with the idea of product innovation

## Identify Problem

* This can take many forms workshops, discovery, research or just talking with stakeholders
* Clearly define the problem and the borders of the problem to focus the scope of the work

## Interview / Prototype

###### _\(note: Ideally starting before development but can happen during delivery\)_

* Meet the users and start interviews and research to further clarify the problem, current processes / infrastructure / work and possible solutions
* Develop clearer picture of product with timeline and MVP ideas
* Develop hypotheses from interviews and research on how to solve solution
* Build out mock ups and prototypes for testing solutions and light weight implementation testing / cost analysis

## Delivery

* Further clarify implementation details and create estimates
* Decide on technology being used to produce the product and create boilerplate
* Regular delivery cadence using Agile / Scrum methodology
* Create CI and CD infrastructure and decide on cadence for pushing to production
* Document process, progress, and code / design choices as the code grows \(aids in next stage\)

## Handoff / Maintainence / Roadmap

* Develop a clear roadmap for product growth and development with highlights around key integrations, releases or decision points

* Ensure the development and designers have a clear idea of how to maintain the codebase and knowledge

* Make documentation easily accessible and understandable in the case of handoff or onboarding new people to the team
