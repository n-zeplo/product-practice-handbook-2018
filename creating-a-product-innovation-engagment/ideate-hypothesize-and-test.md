## Solution: Ideate, Hypothesize and Test

##### Overview:

Once a clear problem has been identified it becomes necessary for the initial team to begin finding the solution and viability of the product that will attempt to solve the problem. This section will focus on the product, research and prototyping team covering topics including:

* Staffing and skill needs during this period

  * Technologists aligned with interaction technology \(data, UI, hardware, etc.\)
  * User / Market Research

  * Visual Design

  * UI Prototyping

  * Product Management

* Discussing expectations and artifact expectations

* Resources:

  * User Research Models / Strategies for features

  * MVP Exercises

  * Non-functional Requirements Exercises

  * Prototyping Examples and Tools

  * Technical Feasibility and Ecosystem Analysis

##### Example Steps in Solutioning:

###### _\(note: Ideally starting before development but can happen during delivery\)_

* Meet the users and start interviews and research to further clarify the problem, current processes / infrastructure / work and possible solutions
* Develop clearer picture of product with timeline and MVP ideas
* Develop hypotheses from interviews and research on how to solve solution
* Build out mock ups and prototypes for testing solutions and light weight implementation testing / cost analysis
