## Interview / Prototype

###### _\(note: Ideally starting before development but can happen during delivery\)_

* Meet the users and start interviews and research to further clarify the problem, current processes / infrastructure / work and possible solutions
* Develop clearer picture of product with timeline and MVP ideas
* Develop hypotheses from interviews and research on how to solve solution
* Build out mock ups and prototypes for testing solutions and light weight implementation testing / cost analysis
