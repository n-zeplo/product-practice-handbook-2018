# Product Innovation Handbook 2018

> The locus of corporate innovations has been product development. But in times of rapid and unpredictable change, the creation of individual products becomes less important than the creation of a general organizational aptitude for innovation. -- John Seely Brown

Product innovation is the act of looking at the problems your users face with a magnifying glass to identify a service or good that uses new or improved technology and processes to solve the users problems. In this book we will attempt to identify the tools that are available to help tackle product innovation, the processes that lead to team success and a number of examples to further your understanding of product innovation engagements.

### Value Proposition:

###### TBD

### Scope of this Book

This wiki is comprised of foundational findings from the industry and multiple client engagements. The intent is to provide a starting point for individuals to understand the core set of information to enable product innovation to succeed. This team has curated the topics of this wiki to provide the most relevant information to the widest selection of product innovation engagements in a small consumable fashion. Insights are drawn from representative and repeated case studies and curated by a core SME team.

### Out Of Scope of this Book

This wiki will not attempt to:

* Define roles at TW and the individual skills of those roles
* Impose a framework for product engagements
* Be a community based knowledge base \(see google sites for community based resources\)

### Who Are We?

We are a group consisting of designers, developers and product people within ThoughtWorks. Through our shared experiences and research into TW product engagements we have compiled the resources here within. We hope that our varied backgrounds and multi year experiences at TW on different projects and products will inform this book and future engagements. We are always looking for help and verification of our findings and encourage all who read this book to reach out to us or make comments inside the gitbook that we can address.
