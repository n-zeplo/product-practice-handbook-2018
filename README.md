# Product Practice Handbook 2018

Product Design is the act of looking at the problems your users face with a magnifying glass to identify, plan and deliver a service or good using new or improved technology and processes to solve the users problems. In this book we will attempt to identify the tools that are available to help tackle product design, the processes that lead to team success and a number of examples to further your understanding of product design engagements.

### Value Proposition:

This Product Design Handbook 2018 is a holistic, comprehensive resource for all to better understand the foundational knowledge that makes up product design. It is an open source resource for the community of product practitioners to contribute and grow the knowledge here within inline with the direction and growth of the industry to maintain relevancy and usefulness. Through the definitions and resources found within this book it becomes a meeting point of ideas and patterns to help jump start conversations and engagements in the product space.

### Scope of this Book
