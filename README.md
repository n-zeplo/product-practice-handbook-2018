# Product Design Handbook 2018

Product Design is the act of looking at the problems your users face with a magnifying glass to identify, plan and deliver a service or good using new or improved technology and processes to solve the users problems. In this book we will attempt to identify the tools that are available to help tackle product design, the processes that lead to team success and a number of examples to further your understanding of product design engagements.

### Value Proposition:

This Product Design Handbook 2018 is a holistic, comprehensive resource for all to better understand the foundational knowledge that makes up product design. It is an open source resource for the community of product practitioners to contribute and grow the knowledge here within inline with the direction and growth of the industry to maintain relevancy and usefulness. Through the definitions and resources found within this book it becomes a meeting point of ideas and patterns to help jump start conversations and engagements in the product space. 

### Scope of this Book

This wiki is comprised of foundational findings from the industry and multiple client engagements. The intent is to provide a starting point for individuals to understand the core set of information to enable product design to succeed. This team has curated the topics of this wiki to provide the most relevant information to the widest selection of product design engagements in a small consumable fashion. Insights are drawn from representative and repeated case studies and curated by a core SME team.

### Out Of Scope of this Book

This wiki will not attempt to:

* Define roles at TW and the individual skills of those roles
* Impose a framework for product engagements
* Be a community based knowledge base \(see google sites for community based resources\)

### Who Are We?

We are a group consisting of designers, developers and product people within ThoughtWorks. Through our shared experiences and research into TW product engagements we have compiled the resources here within. We hope that our varied backgrounds and multi year experiences at TW on different projects and products will inform this book and future engagements. We are always looking for help and verification of our findings and encourage all who read this book to reach out to us or make comments inside the gitbook that we can address.
