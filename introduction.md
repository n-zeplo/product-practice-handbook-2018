# Introduction

Product practice is a tricky concept to define in a simple way. Products work can take many forms depending on an organization's goals and what they provide to their customers. The cornerstone of product work is the utilization and collaboration of multiple specialized areas within an organization to build the right thing. In technology this often consists of a combined understanding and collaboration between business, technology and design to build better, faster and more valuable user centric products.

## Value Proposition:

This Product Practice Handbook 2018 is a holistic, comprehensive resource for all to better understand the foundational knowledge that makes up product engagements. It is an open source resource for the community of product practitioners to contribute and grow this knowledge base inline with the direction and growth of the industry to maintain relevancy and usefulness. Through the definitions and resources found within this book it becomes a meeting point of ideas and patterns to help jump start conversations and engagements in the product space.

## Scope of this Book

This wiki is comprised of foundational findings from the industry and multiple client engagements. The intent is to provide a starting point for individuals to understand the core set of information to enable product design to succeed. This team has curated the topics of this wiki to provide the most relevant information to the widest selection of product design engagements in a small consumable fashion. Insights are drawn from representative and repeated case studies and curated by a core SME team.

## Out Of Scope of this Book

This wiki will not attempt to:

* Define roles at TW and the individual skills of those roles
* Impose a framework for product engagements
* Be a community based knowledge base \(see google sites for community based resources\)
