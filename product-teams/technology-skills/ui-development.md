# User Interface \(UI\) Development

Our products make it to our users through their interfaces. It is only through creating thoughtful interfaces that we can engage our users and solve their problems through the underlying data, technology and services. Therefore, UI development and its collaboration with design is crucial in creating products  of meaning. 

UI development is the process of designing, testing and creating user interfaces using the knowledge of standards, extensibility, interaction design and user research. A UI developer will play a crucial role on a team of working closely within the product practice as the bridge between development and the product, grounding development in the goals of the overall product vision. 

Common areas  of influence for UI Development include:

* [Tech feasibility](https://thoughtworks.gitbook.io/project/~/edit/primary/product-teams/technology-skills/ui-development) -- Working closely to identify for Business and Design the underlying systems available to solve problems
* [Design System Development](https://thoughtworks.gitbook.io/project/~/edit/primary/product-delivery-tools/product-ops/design-systems) -- Working on development of design systems and integrating / maintaining living styleguides
* [Interaction Design](https://thoughtworks.gitbook.io/project/~/edit/primary/product-teams/design-skills/interaction-design) -- Being a voice in  discussing interaction design costs and platform standards for component interactions
