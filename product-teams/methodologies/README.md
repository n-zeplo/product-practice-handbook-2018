# Methodologies

> No matter how good the team or how efficient the methodology, if we're not solving the right problem, the project fails. -- Woody Williams

Methodologies make up the way that our teams work. They enable the teams to collaborate more quickly and efficiently ensuring the team is incorporating multiple viewpoints, perspectives and expertise to enrich and better the overall product.
