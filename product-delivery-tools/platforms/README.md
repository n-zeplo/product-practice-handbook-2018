# Platforms

> “Platform thinking” asserts that by creating discrete, well-factored capabilities around foundational concerns like delivery infrastructure and business functions, managed as products, an organization can reduce friction for delivery and experimentation, paving the way for new sources of business value. We want to be able to offer our clients a coherent, well thought out, productized consulting model built with ‘platform thinking’ at its core that can be delivered in a repeatable, reliable, efficient way; one that facilitates far more effective software delivery than our clients’ present collections of technology investments. -- ThoughtWorks DPS Library of Knowledge

Platforms are the foundation of products and help enable the technology to create better, more unified products that can guide user engagement.
