## Client Examples

**Micro-lender**

* It takes too long to process loan applications \(40-45 days\)
* As loans change based on region and over time the system needs to be scalable

**Online Classified Ads Startup**

* Form based UI is leading to a large drop-off of users
* We would like to gather information from the users ad to organize where the ad should go and how to query for it without having the user enter this information manually 

**NGO that Operates Hospitals in Disaster / Conflict Zones**

* Internet is spotty where our users are however they need to collect data in the moment, how can they use the application while offline and then sync when back online
* The data entered is slightly different based on the user, this creates messy data. How do we correct dirty data and match data that is the same or similar 

**A Large Network Equipment Manufacturer**

* How do we aggregate and organize knowledge across the org?
* How do we automatically gather metadata to allow system to better organize, return and recommend articles the user might be interested in?

**Predictive Sales and Maintenance**

* As data grows the current solution for generating opportunities for maintenance becomes extremely slow leading to lost opportunity.
* Our users have dropped off due to a lack of customizable features that help them make the tool useful to their goals 

**Retailer Price Optimization**

* Pricing items is a manual process that takes time and doesn't reflect competitive market analysis leading to losses through less competitive pricing
* Pricing should be determined automatically with the data from the market, the POS system and predictive demand information to be more competitive in our pricing 

**Supply Chain for American Multinational Consumer Goods Company**

* Supply chain optimizaton to reduce workforce of planners and increase automation for proper supply distribution
* We would like a system to automatically detect events in our sales systems and business systems and take action to ensure the supply chain reacts appropriately

**Anomaly Detection in Leading International Investment Bank**

* System downtime costs potentially millions in losses and an early detection or warning of system downtime would greatly alleviate the cost
* The least stable portion of our products is the shared underlying infrastructure
