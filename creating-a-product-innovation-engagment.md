# Product Engagements

Building an engagement model is more of an art than a science often requiring a balancing of client requests, product needs and available personnel. This section attempts to give insight into this art and the considerations that can lead to more thoughtful and productive engagement models by breaking engagements into key stages.

Every engagement will not go through all of these stages, however, many do go through multiple phases. Each phase requires us to think differently about the ways in which we approach the given set of problems. Here we will outline the lifecycle of engagements with suggestions on focuses during that key lifecycle moment.

###### \*\*This section does not dictate engagement models or staffing but highlights successful setups from previous engagements.
