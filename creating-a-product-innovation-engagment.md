# Engagement Models

Building an engagement model is more of an art than a science often requiring a balancing of client requests, product needs and available personnel. The information in this section attempts to give insight into this art and the considerations that can lead to more thoughtful and productive engagement models.

Every engagement goes through multiple phases that require us to think differently about the ways in which we approach the given set of problems. Here we will outline the lifecycle of engagements with suggestions on focuses during that key lifecycle moment.
