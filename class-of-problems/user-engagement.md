## Ease User Interaction to Avoid Drop Off

User's want to spend as little time on your site as possible to accomplish their goals. Innovative interfaces can allow your product to engage the user in ways that avoid drop off. Identifying the points of drop off allows the team to better identify strategies for preventing drop off. 

#### Example Problems: 

**Drop Off During Sign Up**: Creating sign up options that utilize common accounts such as facebook, Google, LinkedIn, etc. Increase the likelihood that users will sign up for your product. 

**Drop Off Filling Out Forms: **Forms and required information from your client can be a major pain point for users. Shortening forms is a simple solution for some organizations, however, for complex situations using natural language algorithms and machine learning you can extract important meta data and additional fields from paragraph responses or other online user information. 

**Drop Off Due to Complexity: **High levels of complexity in UIs leads to high development costs and can lead to less user engagement if they can not identify the right path to accomplish their goals. Using product validation techniques \(ex. user research, A/B testing, etc.\) the business can identify these complexities and points of confusion and simplify the product to the users goals. If done early and often this can also reduce the cost of developing UIs by reducing complexity.
