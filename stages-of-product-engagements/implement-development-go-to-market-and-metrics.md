# Implement: Development, Go to Market and Metrics

## Overview:

When implementation begins the team should have a clear understanding of the problem and solution they will be working on. This section will focus on the delivery team and ongoing product work and will cover topics including:

* Staffing and skill needs during this period
  * Product Management
  * Technical needs as defined by solution: language, interaction tech, etc.
  * User Researcher / Designer
  * Quality Assurance / Automation
  * Business Analysis / Domain Experts
* Managing Scope and Expectations
* Keeping delivery and Roadmaps aligned
* Go to Market Strateges
* Metric Tools and Analysis
* Best Practices
  * Cross-functional pairing
  * Continuous User Research
* Resources:
  * Implementation Examples
  * Roadmap Examples / Templates
  * Design System / Styleguide Resources
  * Non-functional Requirement Resources / Tracking

## Considerations:

* Further clarify implementation details and create estimates
* Decide on technology being used to produce the product and create boilerplate
* Regular delivery cadence using Agile / Scrum methodology
* Create CI and CD infrastructure and decide on cadence for pushing to production
* Document process, progress, and code / design choices as the code grows \(aids in next stage\)
