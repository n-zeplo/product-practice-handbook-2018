# Strategic Alignment

As organizations expand the ability to align different parts of your organization becomes more difficult. Strategic Alignment aims to create better products and processes to automatically align large groups of people and verticals of an organization. Our products can help direct a strategic alignment through the information product development exposes \(user research\) and through developing process through and around the use of a product.
